# 0. Introduction

As both an aspiring guitarist and product management/analytics professional, I thought it would be a great idea to merge my interests into one project - using data to explore basic guitar music theory and to inform my next steps for learning guitar.

#### Guitar Motivation
For the last year I have been self teaching myself guitar. Like all things I've self-taught in the past, I have spent endless hours on youtube, learning new songs, chords, etc. I feel like I've got the basics down now and can learn most songs after watching a youtube video or finding the chords online. However, I'm hungry now to get into that next level of understanding - music theory. I want to know what and why I'm playing. I've found myself asking questions like - what chords sound good together? Why does chord x always show up after chord y? How can I think about starting to write my own music? What song should I be learning next? I've started diving into these questions through youtube, but like anything, I believed data could help guide my learning and decision making.

#### Data Motivation
Over the last few years, I've really found my interests converging at the intersetion of product and data. In school I was lucky enough to get involved in classes all over the data science spectrum, touching subjects and projects varying from ML to Data Visualization Interaction. Now as a Product manager, I am actively involved in analyzing our business data to help us make decisions on how to build our products!

Although I've done a lot so far, there's still so many more skills that I want to build upon in this space. For example, I've often worked with dirty data, usually in the form of logs generated from our software at work. However, I've never really had to gather it myself. And although I've gotten to answer some really cool questions with data, I've never been able to use data to explore a subject I really know nothing about.

#### Project  Overview

So for this project, I will be working down the data science pipeline from A-Z to explore the basics of music theory while simultaneosly building out my data science skills!

This notebook contains a majority of my work, broken up by each step in the process

1. Data Collection (Done)

2. Data Cleaning (Done)

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (In Progress)

4. Modeling (Not Started)

5. Conclusion/Takeaways (Not Started)
